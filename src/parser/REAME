For the parser we will use the algorithm "Recursive descent parser
"
In out AST the priorities are liek this:
1 - || &&
2 - |
3 - < >
4 - COMMAND
5 - 

Note: if < and << are used at the same command the priority goes from left to
right.


First task a parser for : cat file | grep "D" && ls
First task a parser for : (cat file && grep "D") | wc -l
